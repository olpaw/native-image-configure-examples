# Application Initialization at Build Time

This example demonstrates the ability of native-image to run parts of your application at image-build time.

In both examples we use the Jackson framework to parse a JSON file to determine
which `Handler` should be used by the application (`CurrentTimeHandler` or
`HelloWorldHandler`) at runtime.

* In `configure-at-runtime-example` the JSON parsing happens at image runtime
  and thus contributes to the image startup time. In addition all methods and
  static fields that are part of the Jackson framework that are needed are part
  of the native-image.

* In contrast `configure-at-buildtime-example` performs the JSON parsing as
  part of building the image. In this case the image does not contain any parts
  of the Jackson framework. When this image gets executed it can run the handler
  right away since it was already determined at build time which hander should
  be used.

# Use following instructions to build the examples:
 
* Download GraalVM 19.3.0 from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads.
* Extract the tarball and set `JAVA_HOME` to the GraalVM release directory.
* Install native-image with `$JAVA_HOME/bin/gu install native-image`.
* Change to the example subdirectories and run `mvn package` there.
* Once you are done with building both images run:
  * `$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image --server-shutdown`
* The built executables are:
  * `configure-at-runtime-example/target/configureatruntime`
  * `configure-at-buildtime-example/target/configureatbuildtime`
